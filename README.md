heroku-buildpack-takipi
=======================

This buildpack is used as part of the https://github.com/takipi/heroku-buildpack-jvm-takipi.

However, if you already have a custom buildpack, you can hack https://github.com/takipi/heroku-buildpack-jvm-takipi and add
the buildpack you need before installing Takipi while making sure /app/.jdk is available.
